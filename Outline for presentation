ALM project

Introduction
- State research question
- include the introduction from EDA

Methods
- Describe data and what cleaning was performed (removing secondary diagnosis (specifically to ASD, not     helpful in TD, also ADHD is mostly in primary diagnosis - not many with secondary diagnosis), removing    the variables in WISC 4 and 5 that were not used in the other tests, combining WISC 4 and 5 data)
  - Table 1
- Present the exploratory analysis that motivated the final model groups for each diagnosis group (the      separated smoothed models by diagnosis)
- The final models - need formula and description/explanation
    - **use age and version type for each diagnosis (only do residual analysis for version type because         age is considered a control variable, which we need to state)
    - TD
        - Added variable plot/residual analysis to determine what other variables to include
        - display the final model + formula
    - ADHD
        - Added variable plot/residual analysis to determine what other variables to include
        - Include the subtypes for modeling
        - display the final model + formula
    - ASD
        - Added variable plot/residual analysis to determine what other variables to include
        - Include secondary diagnosis for this specifically, they might have OCD, ADHD, etc. this is most           important for specifically this primary diagnosis, look at ADHD subtype for this one 
        - display the final model + formula

Results
- Present table or plot of each model coefficients (estimates and p-values)
- interpret the coefficients related to motor skills
- report the results of the hypothesis tests used (if used)

Conclusion
- address the relationship between motor skills and social defecits by interpreting model results
